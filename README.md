# SurfExtract
The application extracts a point cloud from all visible surfaces of a mesh model; it ignores all hidden surfaces. 
The tool renders the surface of a 3D model from multiple locations around a sphere into a 32bit fbo. 
The pixels contain just model positions and a point for each valid pixel is created. 
Subsequent sampling prevent duplicates and also allows one to reduce the point cloud density via a voxel grid. 

### Obtaining the code
```console
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/timothygarrett/SurfExtract.git 
```

### Prerequisites
All code runs (tested) on Windows 10, Version 1803, and on Linux.
